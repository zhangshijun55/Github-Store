GitHub Store is a cross‑platform “play store” for GitHub releases.
It discovers repositories that ship real installable binaries and lets you install, track, and update them across platforms from one place.

## ✨ What is GitHub Store?

GitHub Store is a Kotlin Multiplatform app (Android + Desktop) that turns GitHub releases into a
clean, app‑store style experience:

- Only shows repositories that actually provide installable assets (APK, EXE, DMG, AppImage, DEB, RPM, etc.).
- Detects your platform and surfaces the correct installer.
- Always installs from the latest published release, highlights its changelog, and can notify you when updates are available for installed apps (on Android).
- Presents a polished details screen with stats, README, and developer info.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart discovery**
    - Home sections for “Trending”, “Recently Updated”, and “New” projects with time‑based filters.
    - Only repos with valid installable assets are shown.
    - Platform‑aware topic scoring so Android/desktop users see relevant apps first.

- **Latest‑release installs**
    - Fetches `/releases/latest` for each repo.
    - Shows only assets from the latest release.
    - Single “Install latest” action, plus an expandable list of all installers for that release.

- **Rich details screen**
    - App name, version, “Install latest” button.
    - Stars, forks, open issues.
    - Rendered README content (“About this app”).
    - Latest release notes (body) with markdown formatting.

- **Cross‑platform UX**
    - Android: opens APK downloads with the package installer, tracks installations in a local database, and shows them in a dedicated Apps screen with update indicators.
    - Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux): downloads installers to the user’s Downloads folder and opens them with the default handler; no hidden temp locations.

- **Appearance & theming**
- Material 3 design with **Material 3 Expressive** components on all platforms.
- Material You dynamic color support on Android where available.
- Optional AMOLED black mode for dark theme on OLED devices.

- **Safety & inspection (Android)**
- Optional GitHub sign‑in via OAuth device flow for higher rate limits with minimal scopes.
- “Open in AppManager” action to inspect an APK’s permissions and trackers before installing.

## 🔍 How does my app appear in GitHub Store?

GitHub Store does not use any private indexing or manual curation rules.  
Your project can appear automatically if it follows these conditions:

1. **Public repository on GitHub**
    - Visibility must be `public`.

2. **At least one published release**
    - Created via GitHub Releases (not only tags).
    - The latest release must not be a draft or prerelease.

3. **Installable assets in the latest release**
    - The latest release must contain at least one asset file with a supported extension:
        - Android: `.apk`
        - Windows: `.exe`, `.msi`
        - macOS: `.dmg`, `.pkg`
        - Linux: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`
    - GitHub Store ignores GitHub’s auto‑generated source artifacts (`Source code (zip)` /
      `Source code (tar.gz)`).

4. **Discoverable by search / topics**
    - Repositories are fetched via the public GitHub Search API.
    - Topic, language, and description help the ranking:
        - Android apps: topics like `android`, `mobile`, `apk`.
        - Desktop apps: topics like `desktop`, `windows`, `linux`, `macos`, `compose-desktop`,
          `electron`.
    - Having at least a few stars makes it more likely to appear under Popular/Updated/New sections.

If your repo meets these conditions, GitHub Store can find it through search and show it
automatically—no manual submission required.

## 🧭 How GitHub Store works (high‑level)

1. **Search**
    - Uses GitHub’s `/search/repositories` endpoint with platform‑aware queries.
    - Applies simple scoring based on topics, language, and description.
    - Filters out archived repos and those with too few signals.

2. **Release + asset check**
    - For candidate repos, calls `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`.
    - Checks the `assets` array for platform‑specific file extensions.
    - If no suitable asset is found, the repo is excluded from results.

3. **Details screen**
    - Repository info: name, owner, description, stars, forks, issues.
    - Latest release: tag, published date, body (changelog), assets.
    - README: loaded from the default branch and rendered as “About this app”.

4. **Install flow**
    - When the user taps “Install latest”:
        - Picks the best matching asset for the current platform.
        - Streams the download.
        - Delegates to the OS installer (APK installer on Android, default handler on desktop).
        - On Android, records the installation in a local database and uses package monitoring to keep the installed list in sync.

## ✅ Pros / Why use GitHub Store?

- **No more hunting through GitHub releases**
  See only repos that actually ship binaries for your platform.

- **Knows what you installed**
  Tracks apps installed via GitHub Store (Android) and highlights when new releases are available, so you can update them without hunting through GitHub again.

- **Always the latest release**  
  Installs are guaranteed to come from the latest published release; the changelog you see is
  exactly what you’re installing.

- **Uniform experience across platforms**  
  Same UI and logic for Android and desktop, with platform‑native install behavior.

- **Open source & extensible**  
  Written in KMP with a clear separation between networking, domain logic, and UI—easy to fork,
  extend, or adapt.

## 🔑 Configuration

GitHub Store uses a GitHub OAuth app for authentication and API rate‑limit isolation.

1. Create a GitHub OAuth app at **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps**.
2. Set the callback URL to `githubstore://callback` (_Not quite important_).
3. Copy the **Client ID** from the OAuth app.
4. In your project’s `local.properties`, add:

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

GitHub Store only helps you discover and download release assets that are already published on
GitHub by third‑party developers.  
The contents, safety, and behavior of those downloads are entirely the responsibility of their
respective authors and distributors, not this project.

By using GithubStore, you understand and agree that you install and run any downloaded software at
your own risk.  
This project does not review, validate, or guarantee that any installer is safe, free of malware, or
fit for any particular purpose.
